## Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to visualize citibike data in August using Tableau. Using the data, visualizations including peak hours, average trip duration, and a heat map displaying the peak hours were created along with filters for genders. The visualizations are important as they provide information on how much the bikes are used, which could be used to convince investors that there is potential in bike sharing programs.

## Results:
This chart displays the peak NYC citibike hours for the month of August. When looking at the peak hours for August, we can see that most bikes were used at 8 AM, 5 PM, and 6 PM.

This chart displays the duration of bike checkout times. We can see that the majority of bikes were rented for less than 20 minutes at a time.

This is a heatmap displaying the peak times by weekday. It's worth mentioning that the weekend has different peak hours than on the weekdays.

This pie chart provides a breakdown of the gender of NYC citi bike users. Majority of users were male.

This gender difference can be seen when looking at the checkout times and trips per weekday.

Another observation that can be made is that more trips are done by subscribers, opposed to standard customers.

## Summary

After looking at the visualizations, there are some key observations that could convince investors that a bike sharing business could work well in a new area. The first observation is that the peak hours found on the peak hours bar chart and heatmap reflect the hours of the work week. This tells me that the majority of citi bike users are using bikes for their commute to work. An observation that confirms this is that the heat map has higher bikes rented on weekends in between 8 AM and 6 PM. This shows that citibike users use the bikes for work and when they have work off. Another observation which could interest investors is that the majority of users are subscribers, which can be seen on the user trips by gender by weekday heatmap. This could interest investors because subscribers are guaranteed payments coming in, which are more reliable than the payments from non-subscribers. As for the difference in citi bike usage by gender, it is hard to come to a conclusion as to why based on this data alone. To get potential insight on this, comparing the gender breakdown to the whole population of NYC may explain this difference. This could be done by creating a visualization that uses the gender breakdown of NYC Citibike users next to the gender breakdown of the entire city. Another visualization that would be useful could compare the trip duration for subscribers and customers. This could give investors an idea on how to better price subscription and customer fares for more profit.
